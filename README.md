# Avalanche_module_2
This Solidity program is a simple contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language and the working of smart contracts in a blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for a future Web3 and blockchain Journey.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has simple functionality that simulates an online statonary shop and connect it to the frontend. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.
Configure your metamask wallet beforehand in order to run properly.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the functions and passing appropriate values.
